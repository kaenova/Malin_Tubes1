Just having fun makin library for K-Means clustering.  
The K-means module itself is in `./module`
  
Updates on 6 December 2021:  
Finally i made an improvement on the algorithm and now it's 3 times faster than before! You can see the benchmark on `document` folder. Now the algorithm is using Paralel Processing. Please use Python 3.8+ because i use `multiprocessing` native library and i think that library is only supported on the new python version. So don't forget to use Python 3.8 or later ^^.
